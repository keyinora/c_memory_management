# Memory Management

Welcome to **Memory Management**! Understanding how your software interacts with hardware is crucial for writing efficient, performant code. In this course, we will focus on one of the most critical aspects of software performance: memory management.

## Goals of This Course

- **Understand how and where programs store data in memory:** Variables, functions, and objects don't exist for free. We'll explore where they "live" as your code runs.
  
- **Learn to make programs more efficient:** Many performance-related problems in backend software are memory-related. By understanding memory management, you can troubleshoot and optimize your code.

- **Practice programming in a lower-level language:** Writing in C brings you closer to the hardware compared to higher-level languages like Python, JavaScript, or Go. By using C, you'll gain insights into how software interacts directly with the underlying hardware.

- **Understand garbage collection (and build your own):** Many modern languages have garbage collection (like Python, Go, and JavaScript). This course will help you understand the trade-offs involved and even guide you to build a simple garbage collector.

> **Note:** This is **not** a C course. While weâ€™ll be writing C code and covering some C basics, the focus is on memory management, not the C language itself.

## Prerequisites

- **Coding experience:** You should be comfortable coding in at least one language, like Python, JavaScript, or Go.
  
- **CS Basics:** A foundational understanding of algorithms, data structures, OOP, and functional programming concepts is expected.

## Building Sneklang

If you primarily work in high-level languages, you might not typically think about memory. In this course, weâ€™ll build small parts of the **Sneklang** programming language in C to learn about manual memory management. By the end, we'll implement a basic garbage collector for Sneklang so that its developers donâ€™t have to worry as much about memory management.

Interestingly, C was once considered a "high-level" language when it was introduced. In some ways, it still is. Modern compilers and hardware make amazing optimizations. Nonetheless, there's still a lot to learn on our Sneklang journey! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Assignment

It looks like someone confused "Python" with "Sneklang" in the code!

Update the code to print:

```c
Starting the Sneklang interpreter...\n
