# Memory Management

Welcome to **Memory Management**! Understanding how your software interacts with hardware is crucial for writing efficient, performant code. In this course, we will focus on one of the most critical aspects of software performance: memory management.

  <summary>## Goals of This Course</summary>

1. **Understand how and where programs store data in memory:** Variables, functions, and objects don't exist for free. We'll explore where they "live" as your code runs.
2. **Learn to make programs more efficient:** Many performance-related problems in backend software are memory-related. By understanding memory management, you can troubleshoot and optimize your code.
3. **Practice programming in a lower-level language:** Writing in C brings you closer to the hardware compared to higher-level languages like Python, JavaScript, or Go. By using C, you'll gain insights into how software interacts directly with the underlying hardware.
4. **Understand garbage collection (and build your own):** Many modern languages have garbage collection (like Python, Go, and JavaScript). This course will help you understand the trade-offs involved and even guide you to build a simple garbage collector.

> **Note:** This is **not** a C course. While weâ€™ll be writing C code and covering some C basics, the focus is on memory management, not the C language itself.

<details>
  <summary>## Prerequisites</summary>

- **Coding experience:** You should be comfortable coding in at least one language, like Python, JavaScript, or Go.
  
- **CS Basics:** A foundational understanding of algorithms, data structures, OOP, and functional programming concepts is expected.

  <summary>## Building Sneklang</summary>

If you're familiar with super high-level languages, you're probably used to not thinking about memory. In this course, we'll be **building the "Sneklang" programming language** (okay just little parts of it) in C. We will study all about manually managing memory in C, and toward the end of the course, we'll build a simple garbage collector so that Sneklang devs don't have to think too hard.

> A small bit of irony here is that C was originally considered a "high-level" language when it was released. And in fact, in some ways, it still is. Modern compilers & hardware are incredibly cool and make impressive optimizations. But even so, I think there is a lot we can learn together on our Sneklang journey ðŸ˜ƒ

It looks like someone confused "Python" with "Sneklang" in the code!

Update the code to print:

```c
Starting the Sneklang interpreter...\n
